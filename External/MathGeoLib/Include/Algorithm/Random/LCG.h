/** @brief A linear congruential random number generator.

	Uses D.H. Lehmer's Linear Congruential Method (1949) for generating random numbers.
	Supports both Multiplicative Congruential Method (increment==0) and
	Mixed Congruential Method (increment!=0)
	It is perhaps the simplest and fastest method to generate pseudo-random numbers on
	a computer. Per default uses the values for Minimal Standard LCG.

	http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~greenfie/currentcourses/sem090/pdfstuff/jp.pdf

	Pros:
	<ul>
	    <li> Easy to implement.
	    <li> Fast.
	</ul>

	Cons:
	<ul>
	    <li> NOT safe for cryptography because of the easily calculatable sequential
	        correlation between successive calls. A case study:
	        http://www.cigital.com/papers/download/developer_gambling.php

	    <li> Tends to have less random low-order bits (compared to the high-order bits)
	         Thus, NEVER do something like this:

	           u32 numBetween1And10 = 1 + LCGRand.Int() % 10;

	         Instead, take into account EVERY bit of the generated number, like this:

	           u32 numBetween1And10 = 1 + (int)(10.0 * (double)LCGRand.Int()
	                                                      /(LCGRand.Max()+1.0));
	         or simply
	
	           u32 numBetween1And10 = LCGRand.Float(1.f, 10.f);
	</ul> */
